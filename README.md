- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Lehakn
- ðŸ‘€ I love to work with numbers and data. I believe that data tells us more than just numbers, it helps us understand a story. I love to put data into meaningful contexts to help people make sense of it while also creating beautifully simplified charts that communicate everything clearly.
I am the person you need for work related to numbers, charts, graphs, data science, and presentation. I will research new trends, analyze data to see meaningful patterns, plot charts and graphs to illustrate the insights and communicate the conclusions in a visually compelling format.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me through my email: lehak.narnauli.stats@gmail.com
